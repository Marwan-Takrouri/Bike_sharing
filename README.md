# Bike_sharing



Overview of the analysis: Now that we've gotten a good idea of how to create our story, there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis. In Our analysis We will use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:



• Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format 

• Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis 

• Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation



We will achieve that by , adding these new SMART visualizations to show case our final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors by :


• Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.


• Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.


• Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.



***Results ***



Our Results were as follows :
1- checkout times by Users: 

The first graph stands out the check out time and length of rentals trips by users , it shows a length p=of trips of 60 mins , which might be commuting from the outer point to the downtown area or vice versa or it might be representing trips of people using bike rides to get from point A to point B simply.

3- Trips by weekday per hour:
The graph represents the hours structure of peaks that shows 6 Am to 9 pm for both male ,females and unknown distribution Monday thru Friday and weekend, from my point of view the un captured unknown represents tourists maybe or students / kids .
